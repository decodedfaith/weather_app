A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started / Installation Instructions

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to download and Install the Flutter & Dart SDK (>=2.10.0). The docs will also guide you on how to set up your android device or emulator for testing, how to set up VSCode and the required plugins.

2. Run `flutter doctor` to ensure you have everything installed correctly.

3. Once you are done with the above clone the repo locally and open up the project in VSCode.

4. Run `flutter pub get` at the root of the project to install all dependencies.

5. If you are not running an Android emulator already, follow the steps below to launch your Android emulator:

    - Open Android Studio > More Options > AVD Manager > Select a device(e.g Pixel 5 API) and press the play icon.

    - You should see a device you previously created on the list. If you do not see any devices, it means you skipped that step previously. Click on "Create virtual device" to create an emulator OR follow these steps to create one [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-the-android-emulator)

    - Alternatively, you can connect you can use a physical device to test. Follow the steps [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#set-up-your-android-device)

6. Use `flutter run` to start running the project on the connected device.

Debugging Tip: If you encounter any blockers at any point, run `flutter doctor` to help with troubleshooting.
